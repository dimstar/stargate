# This is the Stargate

Its based on the scene from 2001 a space odyssey. We're using css @keyframe with infinite animation on svg markup. This svg markup is within 2 divs set with css 3d perspective.

Omce the page is rendered we then are using jquery (I know. bleh.) to randomize the colors for all the rect svg elements.

You can see [the "stargate" demo here](https://dimstar.github.io/stargate/)
